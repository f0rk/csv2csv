Convert the delimiter or quote character of a CSV file.

Requires python.

Examples:

Imagine we have a file, colors.csv, with the following data:

Id,Color,Color Name,Description,Hex #,Inventory,Add Date
1,red,Red,Having the color of blood,#f00,0.25,2014-10-16
2,green,Green,Having the color of growing grass,#0f0,10.18,2014-08-25
3,blue,Blue,Having the color of the clear sky,#00f,4.67,2014-09-17

To do "nothing" with the file at all:
~$ csv2csv --in-file colors.csv
Id,Color,"Color Name",Description,"Hex #",Inventory,"Add Date"
1,red,Red,"Having the color of blood",#f00,0.25,2014-10-16
2,green,Green,"Having the color of growing grass",#0f0,10.18,2014-08-25
3,blue,Blue,"Having the color of the clear sky",#00f,4.67,2014-09-17

Note that this quoted a number of fields, which shouldn't affect how the CSV is
interpreted.

Alternatively, one can do nothing with:
~$ cat colors.csv | csv2csv
Id,Color,"Color Name",Description,"Hex #",Inventory,"Add Date"
1,red,Red,"Having the color of blood",#f00,0.25,2014-10-16
2,green,Green,"Having the color of growing grass",#0f0,10.18,2014-08-25
3,blue,Blue,"Having the color of the clear sky",#00f,4.67,2014-09-17

To change the delimiter:
~$ cat colors.csv | csv2csv --out-delimiter '|'
Id|Color|"Color Name"|Description|"Hex #"|Inventory|"Add Date"
1|red|Red|"Having the color of blood"|#f00|0.25|2014-10-16
2|green|Green|"Having the color of growing grass"|#0f0|10.18|2014-08-25
3|blue|Blue|"Having the color of the clear sky"|#00f|4.67|2014-09-17

Or to a tab:
~$ cat colors.csv | csv2csv --out-delimiter '\t'
Id	Color	"Color Name"	Description	"Hex #"	Inventory	"Add Date"
1	red	Red	"Having the color of blood"	#f00	0.25	2014-10-16
2	green	Green	"Having the color of growing grass"	#0f0	10.18	2014-08-25
3	blue	Blue	"Having the color of the clear sky"	#00f	4.67	2014-09-17

Additional options exist to change the quote character (default ").
